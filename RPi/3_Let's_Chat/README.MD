# Let's Chat - RPi

We are attempting to use [NodeRed](https://nodered.org/) to provide a dashboard showing data collected from our ESP32 sensors and controllers.
Node Red has been developed by the maker community to reduce the coding effort and learning that would be required in say, C++, to create a solution.

Following the initial getting started videos I was able to rapidly follow the tutorial [Random Nerd Tutorial - esp32-http-get-post-arduino/](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-http-get-post-arduino/)
